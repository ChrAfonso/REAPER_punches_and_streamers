Punches and Streamers
---------------------
by Christian Afonso

REAPER script to overlay punches and streamers over video track. Still early version, some
things might not work all the time.

Usage:
- Put the contents of this folder (or clone this repository) into a subfolder (e.g. 
  "PunchesAndStreamers") of %APPDATA%/Roaming/REAPER/Scripts/ (on Windows - look for 
  analogous folder on Mac).
- Load the script in the Actions Menu (and assign a shortcut)
- Add markers named "P" or "PUNCH" for punches, "S [N COLOR]" or "STREAMER [N COLOR]"
  for streamers (with concluding punch). Optional parameters: N = streamer duration 
  in seconds (default 2), COLOR = streamer color (default white, currently also possible:
  [red yellow green blue magenta cyan black]; add a - in front to suppress the default
  punch at the end, e.g. "S 3 -red" for a 3-second red streamer without a punch)
- Call the script. It should add two tracks "Streamers" and "Punches" (if not already
  existing), add a "remove black" Video FX to the Punches track, and then add items for 
  every marker matching the specified patterns. The streamer items should automatically
  get a "streamer" Video FX. Additional "Streamers" tracks are created in case of over-
  lapping streamers (due to only one concurrent video effect being displayed per track).

This script is a work-in-progress, provided as-is without any warranties.
You can use it however you like, but at your own risk (Meaning: save your project 
before using it!)
