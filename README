Punches and Streamers
---------------------
by Christian Afonso

REAPER script to overlay punches and streamers over video track. Very rudimentary version.

Usage:
- Put CAfonso folder containing the update_streamers script and needed data files into
%APPDATA%/Roaming/REAPER/Scripts/ folder (look for analogous folder on Mac).
- Load the script in the Actions Menu (and assign a shortcut)
- Add markers named "P" or "PUNCH" for punches, "S [N COLOR]" or "STREAMER [N COLOR]"
  for streamers. Optional parameters: N = streamer duration in seconds (default 2), 
  COLOR = streamer color (default white, currently also possible: red yellow green, 
  add a - in front to suppress the punch at the end, e.g. "S 3 -red" for a 3-second
  streamer without a punch)
- Call the script. It should add two tracks "Streamers" and "Punches" and add one
  Video FX to each of them (chroma key for streamers, remove black for punches), and
  then add items for every marker matching the specified patterns.

This script is a work-in-progress, provided as-is without any warranties.
You can use it however you like, but at your own risk (Meaning: save your project 
before using it!)
